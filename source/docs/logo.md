# Logo {#logo}

The company logo can be set up in the config folder of the desired domain. Inside the `metatag.php` file, we can configure:
- Header logo
- Footer logo
- Login(Square) logo

The right syntax to link the logo is `[module_name]::img/[logo_name].[extension]`.
The logo image must be placed inside the folder `/[Module_name]/Resources/img/`
